- [ ] Schedule re-deployment

## Environment-Specific Commands

### Development
```bash
# Setup
./scripts/setup_env.sh dev --database

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh dev up

# Validate
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Testing
```bash
# Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh test up

# Run tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm app pytest
```

### Acceptance
```bash
# Generate secrets
./scripts/manage_secrets.sh generate acc

# Validate config
python scripts/validate_config.py acc

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh acc up --build

# Check status
./scripts/deploy.sh acc status
```

### Production
```bash
# Generate secrets
./scripts/manage_secrets.sh generate prod

# Validate config
python scripts/validate_config.py prod

# Backup current deployment
